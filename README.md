## Side-by-side menu trial

`/food` and `/drink` stay unchanged. `/food-live` and `/drink-live` read the same Prismic
documents and add live Toast availability and NEW labels. The trial routes are not in the
navigation or sitemap. They also use `noindex,nofollow` so search engines do not list them.

Merging this pull request does not replace the current menu routes. The current `/food` and
`/drink` pages remain the public menu while the unlisted `/food-live` and `/drink-live` pages run
beside them for review. Replacing the current menu handles is a separate future change. Make that
change only after the trial has run for an agreed period and the website owner accepts the result.

Set `DASHBOARD_STOCK_API_URL` and `DASHBOARD_STOCK_API_TOKEN` in Vercel Preview and Production.
The token stays on the server. The page checks stock every 30 seconds while it is visible. It
removes live labels after five failed checks. It also rejects stock data older than 45 minutes.
Add `?stock-preview=1` to either trial route to show sample labels during review.

The Prismic `remove_items` field is the switch labeled `86 item`. On the current menu, this switch
hides the card. On a trial menu, a named card stays visible and shows `Temporarily unavailable`.
This manual switch has priority because it remains active even when Toast reports the item as
available. Empty menu placeholders stay hidden. A named item that is no longer sold, such as Drip
Coffee, can be excluded on its trial route. `/drink-live` excludes Drip Coffee because it is
retired. If the item returns, remove `drip-coffee` from `retiredCardKeys` in
`src/routes/drink-live/+page.svelte` after review. This exclusion does not change Prismic or the
current `/drink` page.

For a real stock test, use the trial route without `?stock-preview=1`. The Vercel environment must
have both stock settings, the dashboard stock feed must be current, and the Toast item must have a
confirmed website mapping. The sample query does not call the stock feed.

Dashboard pull request #145 was merged as commit
`d99913f15be162942aacd461a86ec9a2c5aede99`. Vercel production deployment
`dpl_48q8YZW1DL1osgxhVnp8AEZR2qZF` reached READY on `level-one-dashboard.vercel.app` from that exact
commit. Its production logs had no errors in the 15-minute check period.

The dashboard release has a two-step activation safeguard for new automatic mappings. The first
refresh gets fresh Toast stock evidence for each proposed identity. The second refresh activates
the mappings only when every identity for the website card has fresh, valid evidence. New pairs
start in review and activate together for each card. Existing active and manual mappings do not
change while new evidence is pending. This process does not create a stock state from missing data.

The controlled first refresh checked all 54 proposed drink cards. It found 52 available, 2
unavailable, and 0 unknown. The second refresh activated a feed of 87 website cards: 86 use Toast
mappings, with 32 food cards and 54 drink cards. Drip Coffee is the one default card. It remains
hidden only on `/drink-live` because it is retired.

On September 7, 2026, Garlic Breadsticks passed the full food test on the personal `/food-live`
deployment. Changing the Toast stock value from blank to `0` made the proxy report the item as
unavailable and the page showed `Temporarily unavailable` automatically. Restoring the Toast value
made the proxy and page available again. Garlic Breadsticks remains restored and available.

On the same date, Summer Slam passed the full drink test on `/drink-live`. Changing its Toast stock
value from blank to `0` made the proxy report it as unavailable and showed the label automatically
on desktop. The label also fit in a 390 by 844 browser viewport. The page content width was 380
pixels, so there was no horizontal overflow. The browser console had no errors. Restoring the Toast
value removed the label automatically on desktop and at the mobile browser size. Summer Slam
remains restored and available. Toast applied the stock changes after Save; the full menu did not
need publication.

The tested personal preview uses website commit `ab037fe0abf7f140e0a6c183e04827d9cb00a065`:

- Live food: https://lvl1-stock-preview-kfjqqces1-alessandro-argentina-s-projects.vercel.app/food-live
- Live drinks: https://lvl1-stock-preview-kfjqqces1-alessandro-argentina-s-projects.vercel.app/drink-live
- Sample food: https://lvl1-stock-preview-kfjqqces1-alessandro-argentina-s-projects.vercel.app/food-live?stock-preview=1

A later documentation-only commit can create a different Vercel preview URL. The links above identify
the tested code commit. Vercel Deployment Protection can require a login.

To stop the trial before merge, close this pull request or delete its branch. After merge, revert
the pull request in GitHub. This removes the trial routes and stock proxy. The existing `/food` and
`/drink` routes do not change during the trial.
