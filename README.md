## Live menu availability

`/food` and `/drink` show every menu item. An item that is unavailable is labeled
`Temporarily unavailable` with a diagonal stripe over a greyed photo, rather than
being removed from the page.

An item is labeled unavailable when either:

- **Toast** reports it out of stock, via the dashboard stock feed. No Prismic
  publication or site rebuild is needed; the label appears and clears on its own.
- **Prismic** has the `Temporarily unavailable` switch on. This is the manual override and it wins
  even when Toast says the item is available.

Toast items are matched to Prismic cards by their `Website Menu ID`, so renaming a
card is safe. A card with no ID yet falls back to its title, and renaming that card
does break the match until the ID is filled in — the item then shows as available
with no error, so check the ID first when a label does not appear.

Cards with the `Temporarily unavailable` switch on and no image, price, text or notes are treated as
empty Prismic placeholders and stay hidden. Give a card a price to keep it visible.

To retire an item for good, delete its card in Prismic.

### Stock feed

Set `DASHBOARD_STOCK_API_URL` and `DASHBOARD_STOCK_API_TOKEN` in Vercel Preview and
Production; see `.env.example`. The token stays on the server behind `/api/menu-stock`.

Only `/food` and `/drink` check stock. Other pages using the same `MenuItems` slice
(`/wizard`) never call the feed and never render its labels, including after a
client-side navigation away from a menu page.

Each card is matched to the stock feed by its `Website Menu ID`, a permanent value
the dashboard also uses. Cards that don't have one yet fall back to the old rule —
their title, lowercased and hyphenated — so the field can be backfilled gradually.
Once a card is linked, its ID must not change.

The page re-checks every 30 seconds while visible and keeps the last confirmed labels
if the feed fails, so an outage can never make an unavailable item look available.
Stock data older than 45 minutes is rejected as stale, and `/api/menu-stock` forwards
only `key`, `name`, `unavailable`, `isNew` and `source`.

Add `?stock-preview=1` to `/food` or `/drink` to render sample labels without calling
the feed, for reviewing the design. The server decides whether it is allowed: it works
in `npm run dev` and in Vercel Preview builds, and does nothing in production.
